# Quora-platform
Just focusing on REST API's and used CRUD operations 
This repository contains the backend implementation of a Quora-like platform using Node.js, Express, and EJS. The platform focuses on providing RESTful APIs to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing posts.

Description:
The Quora Platform API is designed to provide the core functionalities of a Q&A platform, specifically focusing on the ability to upload, edit, and remove posts. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, with EJS used for templating. The API is designed to be RESTful, ensuring that the CRUD operations are performed efficiently and in a standardized manner.

Tech Stack:
Node.js: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Express: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
EJS (Embedded JavaScript): Simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
JSON: Format for structuring data.

CRUD Operations:
The Quora Platform API supports the following CRUD operations for posts:

Create: Allows users to create new posts.
Read: Allows users to retrieve existing posts.
Update: Allows users to update existing posts.
Delete: Allows users to delete existing posts.


Challenges:
While developing the Quora Platform API, several challenges were encountered:

Data Validation: Ensuring that all incoming data is valid and conforms to the expected schema.
Error Handling: Providing meaningful error messages and handling various error scenarios gracefully.
Performance Optimization: Ensuring that the API performs well under load and efficiently handles a large number of requests.


This is done only to improve my skills towards RESTAPI's doesn't used styling so,I will update it later if any changes are needed 
Feel free to customize this README file further based on your project's specific needs and features.
